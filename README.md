to download this project, select the clone or download button, download as zip and extract it to the desired location.

The other option is to download Git bash: https://git-scm.com/downloads (Just hit all the nexts) and opening git bash in the location of where you want to download it to (one can right-click and select the git bash option) and then type in `git clone https://github.com/dskcoding2018/lesson2` . If you do not have the context menu option, first type `cd $mylocation` beforehand, e.g. if you want to clone it into your my documents: `cd c:/users/temporary/documents` and then run the clone commmand. Note the yellow text stating your location.
